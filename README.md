## SamO
The Sampling Ontology

# Abstract
The Sampling Ontology offers a set concepts and properties to describe sampling in music on the Semantic Web. It is an extension of the Music Ontology (mo) and is based on the relationships used by whosampled.com.

# Introduction to SamO
The Sampling Ontology (SamO) is an extension of the Music Ontology (MO) based on the semantic relationships between songs as described by WhoSampled, the most popular online repository for sampling data at time of publication. SamO was created as part of the final examination for the Knowledge Extraction course within the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge master's course at the University of Bologna, a/y 2020-2021. The primary goal of the ontology was to devise a way to describe both the concept and practice of sampling within modern music on the Semantic Web in a way that could be useful to other researcher and academics as well as music fans. Furthermore, while WhoSampled offered a public API until the late 2010s their subsequent move to monetize their data and framework (and thus remove access to it) also motivated the creation of SamO as a possible way to create alternate, public sampling repositories within the Semantic Web.
