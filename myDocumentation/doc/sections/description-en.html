<span class="markdown">
<p>SamO was developed to answer a few questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Can we use knowledge representation and extraction methods to describe the logic and semantics of sampling within modern music production practices?</li>
    <li>Can we effectively express which songs — or, indeed, parts of songs — have been used in order to create a new piece of music?</li>
    <li>Can we describe the transformation process of a song element into a sample via manipulation?</li>
</ul>
<p>See the website for a full explanation of the project as well as visual documentation.</p>
